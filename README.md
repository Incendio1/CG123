**Abstract:** Deciphering latent cancer driver genes is critical for advancing clinical interventions and therapeutic development. However, oncogenesis arises from cumulative genomic alterations and regulatory interactions, presenting challenges of topological heterophily, long-range dependency, and multiscale synergy. CGMap is a novel graph representation learning framework driven by width perspective and path awareness to address these challenges. It robustly identifies cancer genes under heterophily, outperforming 12 baseline methods, and achieves up to three orders of magnitude speedup, enabling large-scale molecular network analysis.

## ðŸš€ Key Features
